Hi! I’m y0ru1ch1, a beginner exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I’ve recently started diving into CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges to learn how web applications work — and sometimes how they can be broken in interesting ways.

I’m especially interested in things like SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, and how cookies and tokens are used in web security. I’ve been learning by trying out different challenges, using tools like Burp Suite, and asking lots of questions to understand how things really work under the hood.

I created this blog to document what I’m learning and the progress I achieve along the way. If you're also learning cybersecurity or just getting started with CTFs, I hope you find something helpful (or relatable) here!
