## About Me

Hi! I’m **y0ru1ch1**, a beginner exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.  
I’ve recently started diving into **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges to understand how web applications work — and how they can sometimes be exploited in creative ways.

I'm especially interested in:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication flaws
- Cookies, tokens, and web security mechanisms

I learn by trying out challenges, using tools like **Burp Suite**, and experimenting through trial and error.  
This blog is my way of documenting what I’m learning, the roadblocks I face, and the small wins along the way.

If you're also starting out in cybersecurity, I hope my journey helps or inspires you.  
Let’s keep learning — one bug at a time!
