    "content": "WWCTF  WWCTF (World Wide Capture The Flag) is an international cybersecurity competition that brings together enthusiasts, students, and professionals to test and enhance their skills in various fields of cybersecurity. It follows the Capture The Flag (CTF) format, where participants solve challenges to capture ‚Äúflags‚Äù ‚Äî pieces of text that prove they‚Äôve solved a problem.  WWCTF includes a wide spectrum of categories such as:  Web Exploitation: Identify flaws in web apps like XSS, SQLi, SSRF, etc.  Pwn: Analyze and exploit binary vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format strings).  Reverse Engineering: Understand how binaries or software work by deconstructing them.  Cryptography: Break or exploit flawed encryption schemes.  Forensics: Recover data from network traffic, memory dumps, or disk images.  OSINT: Use open-source information to gather clues.  Lost 1  OSINT    I used Google lens and "

    "content": "picoCTF    About picoCTF: picoCTF is a cybersecurity competition for middle and high school students, but it‚Äôs also an amazing playground for anyone new to CTFs. It features a wide variety of challenges in areas like:  Binary Exploitation  Web Exploitation  Forensics  Cryptography  Reverse Engineering  General Skills  Each challenge gives a practical exposure to real-world hacking techniques‚Äîsafely and legally.  This is their Official webpage - https://picoctf.org/  This is their url for picoGym - https://play.picoctf.org/practice  Cookie Monster Secret Recipe   Explanation: After accessing the website, we are greeted with a login page prompting for a username and password. Upon entering random credentials, the login attempt fails. However, an interesting hint is displayed: ‚ÄúCheck the cookie.‚Äù    Inspecting the browser‚Äôs cookies, we notice one that appears to be Base64-encoded. This suggests the application might be storing flag in a way that can be decoded and potentially manipulated.    Finally got the flag,  Flag: picoCTF{c1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_6C2FB7F3}  SSTI   Explanation: After launching website,We identified an SSTI vulnerability by injecting a Jinja2 payload ({{7*7}} ) and confirmed code execution using os.popen. Then, we listed directories, found the flag at /challenge/flag, and read it using a Jinja2-based payload to extract the flag.    Flag: picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_73c99823}  WebDecode    Explanation: After launching the instance, the website loaded successfully. I began by inspecting the webpage for any hidden elements or clues that might contain the flag. During this inspection, I discovered a suspicious-looking string that appeared to be Base64-encoded.    I copied the encoded text and decoded it using shell. Upon decoding, the hidden message was revealed ‚Äî it was the flag.  Flag: picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_10f9376f} "
