# Pick your SQL exploit

![alt text](/assets/lib/Pick_Your_sql_exploit.png)

# Explanation

Discovered a SQL injection vulnerability in a library search feature.
By manipulating the input, I accessed hidden database tables and uncovered one called library_secrets.

After exploring its structure, I retrieved a secret flag stored inside.
This challenge demonstrated classic UNION-based SQLi in a SQLite backend.
Flag successfully exfiltrated! üèÅ

**Flag:** `picoCTF{SQL_UNION_4774CK_82de4969}`
