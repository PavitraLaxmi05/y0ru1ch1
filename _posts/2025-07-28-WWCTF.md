# WWCTF

WWCTF (World Wide Capture The Flag) is an international cybersecurity competition that brings together enthusiasts, students, and professionals to test and enhance their skills in various fields of cybersecurity. It follows the Capture The Flag (CTF) format, where participants solve challenges to capture "flags" — pieces of text that prove they've solved a problem.

WWCTF includes a wide spectrum of categories such as:

Web Exploitation: Identify flaws in web apps like XSS, SQLi, SSRF, etc.

Pwn: Analyze and exploit binary vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format strings).

Reverse Engineering: Understand how binaries or software work by deconstructing them.

Cryptography: Break or exploit flawed encryption schemes.

Forensics: Recover data from network traffic, memory dumps, or disk images.

OSINT: Use open-source information to gather clues.

I uploaded the provided image to Google Lens, which is great for reverse image searching based on visual similarity.Google Lens quickly matched the scene with images from Sea Panedrom in Nice, Fabron (France).I searched "Sea Panedrom, Nice, Fabron" on Google Maps.The buildings and layout were identical, confirming this was the correct location.Once the correct spot was located, I copied the latitude and longitude.I formatted them as required and submitted them as the flag.

In the Domain of Doom challenge, I analyzed the Flask source code and discovered a hidden /flag route that returned the flag from an environment variable. By directly visiting /flag in the browser, I was able to retrieve the flag without needing to bypass input filters or trigger any injections.

**Flag:** wwf{Command_1nj3ctI0n_l5_c0ol}

In the Community Challenge, I joined the official Discord server and navigated to the #community-challenge channel. From the pinned messages, I found a YouTube video link. Checking the video’s comment section, I discovered the flag hidden in one of the top comments — solving the challenge by simply exploring the community resources as hinted.
