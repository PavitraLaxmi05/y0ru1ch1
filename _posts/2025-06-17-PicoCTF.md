## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe
<img src="/assets/lib/cookiemonstor.png" alt="challenge" width="500" height="500">

### Explanation:
After accessing the website, we are greeted with a login page prompting for a username and password. Upon entering random credentials, the login attempt fails. However, an interesting hint is displayed: “Check the cookie.”

Inspecting the browser's cookies, we notice one that appears to be Base64-encoded. This suggests the application might be storing flag in a way that can be decoded and potentially manipulated.

Finally got the flag,

**Flag:** `picoCTF{c1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_6C2FB7F3}`

## SSTI

### Explanation:
After launching website,We identified an SSTI vulnerability by injecting a Jinja2 payload (&#123;&#123;7*7&#125;&#125;
) and confirmed code execution using os.popen. Then, we listed directories, found the flag at /challenge/flag, and read it using a Jinja2-based payload to extract the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_73c99823}` 

# WebDecode

### Explanation:
After launching the instance, the website loaded successfully. I began by inspecting the webpage for any hidden elements or clues that might contain the flag. During this inspection, I discovered a suspicious-looking string that appeared to be Base64-encoded.

I copied the encoded text and decoded it using shell. Upon decoding, the hidden message was revealed — it was the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_10f9376f}`

# Uniminify

# Explanation:
After Launching the instance, I began to view sourc code by clicking ctrl+u and then the code is in a single line. After by clicking ctrl+f, I searched for picoCTF and got through all chances and got the flag.

**Flag:**`picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_b99eb82e}`

# Bookmarket

![alt text](/assets/lib/bookmarklet.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the website, There is javascript code is displayed on the webpage and the flag is encrypted and stored in a variable. The code is given to get the decrypted flag. So I copied the code and executed using vscode and got the real flag.

# Intro to Burp

![alt text](/assets/lib/IntrotoWeb.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was greeted with a registration form. I filled in the required details and submitted the form. As expected, the application implemented two-step verification and prompted me for an OTP.

Here's where the twist came in.

I intercepted the OTP request using Burp Suite, and entered a random OTP, it displays the otp in the request.

I simply removed the OTP parameter from the request before forwarding it.Surprisingly, the server didn’t validate the missing OTP properly and directly granted access — revealing the flag on the next page!

**Flag:** `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_e1eb16ed}`

# n0s4n1ty 1

![alt text](/assets/lib/n0s4n1ty.png)

# Explanation:

After loading the website, I noticed a file upload option. Upon attempting to upload a file, an error was shown. Inspecting the source code revealed the site was running on an Apache server, indicating a potential for PHP code execution. I crafted a PHP file containing <?php system($_GET['mycommand']); ?> and uploaded it. Once the file was uploaded, I modified the URL to pass system commands through the mycommand parameter, which successfully executed on the server and revealed the flag.

# head-dump

![alt text](/assets/lib/head-dump.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was presented with a simple blog, as described in the challenge. While exploring, I noticed a #API Documents hashtag. Clicking on it redirected me to the Swagger UI. There, I found a GET /headdump endpoint. 

![alt text](/assets/lib/headdump2.png)

Executing this request returned a PDF file. I opened it and used Ctrl+F to search through the content—this revealed the flag embedded within the document.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_f1179e46}`

# Local Authority

![alt text](/assets/lib/Local_Authority.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was greeted with a simple login page. I tried logging in with random credentials, but it returned a "login failed" message.

Curious, I opened the browser's developer tools and started inspecting the page. While looking through the source code, I discovered a JavaScript file named secure.js. On examining the contents of this file, I found hardcoded admin credentials.

I went back to the login page, entered the admin username and password found in secure.js, and successfully logged in and the flag was revealed on the dashboard.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}`

# Includes

![alt text](/assets/lib/Includes.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, the website loaded with some basic content and a button labeled "Say Hello". Clicking the button triggered a message saying:

"This code is in a separate file!"

That was my cue to dig deeper.

I opened the browser’s developer tools and started inspecting the source files. In the script.js file, I found half of the flag cleverly hidden in a comment. Continuing the search, I checked style.css—and there it was—the other half of the flag, also hidden within a comment.

Combining both parts gave me the complete flag.
