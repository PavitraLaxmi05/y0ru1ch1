## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe
<img src="/assets/lib/cookiemonstor.png" alt="challenge" width="500" height="500">

### Explanation:
After accessing the website, we are greeted with a login page prompting for a username and password. Upon entering random credentials, the login attempt fails. However, an interesting hint is displayed: “Check the cookie.”

Inspecting the browser's cookies, we notice one that appears to be Base64-encoded. This suggests the application might be storing flag in a way that can be decoded and potentially manipulated.

# Intro to Burp

![alt text](/assets/lib/IntrotoWeb.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was greeted with a registration form. I filled in the required details and submitted the form. As expected, the application implemented two-step verification and prompted me for an OTP.

Here's where the twist came in.

I intercepted the OTP request using Burp Suite, and entered a random OTP, it displays the otp in the request.

![alt text](/assets/lib/introtoburp2.png)

I simply removed the OTP parameter from the request before forwarding it.Surprisingly, the server didn’t validate the missing OTP properly and directly granted access — revealing the flag on the next page!

**Flag:** `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_e1eb16ed}`

# n0s4n1ty 1

![alt text](/assets/lib/n0s4n1ty.png)

# Explanation:

After loading the website, I noticed a file upload option. Upon attempting to upload a file, an error was shown. Inspecting the source code revealed the site was running on an Apache server, indicating a potential for PHP code execution. I crafted a PHP file containing <?php system($_GET['mycommand']); ?> and uploaded it. Once the file was uploaded, I modified the URL to pass system commands through the mycommand parameter, which successfully executed on the server and revealed the flag.

# head-dump

![alt text](/assets/lib/head-dump.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was presented with a simple blog, as described in the challenge. While exploring, I noticed a #API Documents hashtag. Clicking on it redirected me to the Swagger UI. There, I found a GET /headdump endpoint. 

![alt text](/assets/lib/headdump2.png)

Executing this request returned a PDF file. I opened it and used Ctrl+F to search through the content—this revealed the flag embedded within the document.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_f1179e46}`

# Local Authority

![alt text](/assets/lib/Local_Authority.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was greeted with a simple login page. I tried logging in with random credentials, but it returned a "login failed" message.

Curious, I opened the browser's developer tools and started inspecting the page. While looking through the source code, I discovered a JavaScript file named secure.js. On examining the contents of this file, I found hardcoded admin credentials.

I went back to the login page, entered the admin username and password found in secure.js, and successfully logged in and the flag was revealed on the dashboard.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}`

# Includes

![alt text](/assets/lib/Includes.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, the website loaded with some basic content and a button labeled "Say Hello". Clicking the button triggered a message saying:

"This code is in a separate file!"

That was my cue to dig deeper.

I opened the browser’s developer tools and started inspecting the source files. In the script.js file, I found half of the flag cleverly hidden in a comment. Continuing the search, I checked style.css—and there it was—the other half of the flag, also hidden within a comment.

Combining both parts gave me the complete flag.

# Cookies

![alt text](/assets/lib/cookies.png)

# Explanation:
After launching the instance, I inspected the website and noticed that changing the cookie value resulted in different cookie names appearing.

![alt text](/assets/lib/cookie2.png)

I began testing by incrementing the cookie value step by step. At value 18, the flag was revealed.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_bb3b3535}`

# Scavenger Hunt

![alt text](/assets/lib/scavanger_hunt.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I explored the website and began inspecting the source files.Using the hints provided on the site, I checked the HTML and CSS files and discovered parts of the flag hidden in comments and code.By piecing together all the parts from different files, I was able to reconstruct the full flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}`

# Get_aHEAD

![alt text](/assets/lib/Get_ahead.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I found a simple website with two buttons — one red and one blue. Clicking them changed the background color accordingly (red or blue).I intercepted the button requests using Burp Suite, and noticed they were being sent as POST requests.

![alt text](/assets/lib/get_ahead2.png)

Out of curiosity, I changed the request method to HEAD — and that’s when the flag was returned in the response headers!

**Flag:** `picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_775f2530}`

# dont-use-client-side

![alt text](/assets/lib/don't_use_client_side.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, I was presented with a page that asked for a password.

I inspected the page source and found a JavaScript function responsible for verifying the password. The logic revealed multiple substring checks to validate specific segments of the password.

![alt text](/assets/lib/dont_trust_client.png)

By analyzing the script, I pieced together the correct password from the substring checks and that was the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{no_clients_plz_b706c5}`

# logon

![alt text](/assets/lib/logon.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, the website loaded a login page with username and password fields.
Upon logging in, I inspected the cookies and noticed there was no input sanitization. One of the cookies was named something like admin and was set to false.
I manually changed the value of the admin cookie to true using browser dev tools.

![alt text](/assets/lib/logon2.png)

After refreshing the page, the website treated me as an admin and displayed the flag directly on the webpage.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_d1c24fef}`

# Insp3ct0r

![alt text](/assets/lib/inspector.png)

# Explanation:

After launching the instance, a static webpage was loaded. Given the challenge name Inspector, I decided to inspect the site thoroughly using browser developer tools.By checking the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source files, I discovered three parts of the flag hidden across the code in comments.After collecting all the parts and combining them, I successfully reconstructed the full flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}`

# Where are the robots

![alt text](/assets/lib/where_are_the_robots.png)

# Explanation:
After launching the instance, I noticed the challenge name hinted at something related to robots.txt.I manually visited /robots.txt by appending it to the URL and found a disallowed path:

Disallow: /8028f.html

I navigated to /8028f.html in the browser — and the flag was displayed on the page.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_8028f}`
