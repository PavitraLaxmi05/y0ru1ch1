## Cookie Monster Secret Recipe

### Explanation:
After accessing the website, we are greeted with a login page prompting for a username and password. Upon entering random credentials, the login attempt fails. However, an interesting hint is displayed: “Check the cookie.”

Inspecting the browser's cookies, we notice one that appears to be Base64-encoded. This suggests the application might be storing flag in a way that can be decoded and potentially manipulated.

Finally got the flag,

**Flag:** `picoCTF{c1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_6C2FB7F3}`

## SSTI

### Explanation:
After launching website,We identified an SSTI vulnerability by injecting a Jinja2 payload (&#123;&#123;7*7&#125;&#125;
) and confirmed code execution using os.popen. Then, we listed directories, found the flag at /challenge/flag, and read it using a Jinja2-based payload to extract the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_73c99823}` 

# WebDecode

### Explanation:
After launching the instance, the website loaded successfully. I began by inspecting the webpage for any hidden elements or clues that might contain the flag. During this inspection, I discovered a suspicious-looking string that appeared to be Base64-encoded.

I copied the encoded text and decoded it using shell. Upon decoding, the hidden message was revealed — it was the flag.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_10f9376f}`
